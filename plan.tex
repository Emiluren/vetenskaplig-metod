\chapter{Problem Description}
\section{Background}
NP (non-deterministic Polynomial) denotes the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time given a non-deterministic Turing machine (NDTM). These come paired with a functional problem, forming the class FNP (functional non-deterministic), with the NP problem typically asking whether its FNP equivalent has a solution. Analogous to solving a problem with a NDTM, a NP-problem's solution may be validated in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine such as a classical computer, given the paired FNP-solution. Furthermore, a problem is described as NP-hard if it can be shown that any problem in NP can be reduced into it, with at most a polynomial change in problem size. Importantly, NP-hard problems which themselves belong to NP, called NP-complete, hold both these traits, being verifiable in polynomial time on a classical computer and presenting a worst-case computational difficulty for the whole of NP. \cite{CCAMA}

Grover’s Search algorithm is a quantum algorithm which solves SAT-problems (boolean constraint satisfaction problems). It also solves their FNP equivalent that is, producing a set of boolean values which satisfy the constraints, if at all possible, with a quadratic reduction in complexity relative iterating over proposed FNP-solutions and attempting to validate these.\cite{QCQI}\cite{CCAMA} The most encompassing of SAT-problems are NP-complete. The “search” phrasing relates to the applicability in searching lists already converted into a quantum circuit, which it achieves in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ time for $N$ elements. In brevity this is achieved by repeated application of a circuit based on the relevant validation algorithm, shifting the potential value space of an array of superposition qbits into the set of outcomes that fulfil the validation, if the set is non-empty. This is a variation of what is called Amplitude Amplification. While this polynomial speed-up is not enough to provide NP-problems a solution in polynomial time, it may as much as double the computable input size from what is achievable in classical computing.\cite{EIQC}

In this thesis we approach the applicability of Grover's Search in solving a wide variety of NP-complete problems. In particular, we look at the achievable growth in problem size during reduction to SAT-format for problems representative of different categories of problems. There are several benefits to bettering the understanding of such growth, and relations between different NP-complete problems. They chiefly pertain to improving the calculability of otherwise difficult-to-approach problems by as much as doubling the input sizes for which they are solvable, given future advances in construction of quantum computers; potentially the only such option if both BQP (quantum-computer polynomial) and P (deterministic Turing machine-polynomial) complexity classes are separate from NP, as is a widely held but unproven belief. There is also a hope to better the understanding of interrelations between problems, particularly within the NP-complete set. Lastly, the project aims to increase interest in quantum computation and quantum algorithms, by presenting uses outside of solving BQP problems, should a delimitation on the class ever be proven.

\section{Research questions}
The thesis tackles the following questions/tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are an appropriate set of example problems to analyse with regard to the following questions?
    \item For the problems treated, what worst-case growth in size can we establish during reduction into a Grover-searchable format?
    \item For which of these is the growth sufficiently small that applying Grover's Search to them produces a useful speedup relative both to best-known classical algorithms, and to the trivial solution?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can we prove a lower-bound in growth for any problems where we fail to produce a sufficient reduction, and so prove the approach pointless?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}
Here we collect a number of related papers. These have been selected because they either deal with reduction of problems into SAT, as is appropriate for our thesis, or because they somehow apply Grover Search to provide a speedup over classical algorithms, similar to what we aim to do but with narrower focus and greater depth.

\subsection{Quantum search algorithm tailored to clause satisfaction problems}
Avatar Tulsi has done some work on an alternative search algorithm to the selective phase inversion of the solution state in Grover's algorithm. The algorithm is specifically tailored to clause satisfaction problems and relaxes the requirement of coupling between computation circuits for each binary function that is part of the clause. Because of this it has a potential to save computational resources required to implement the oracle transformation in Grover's search.\cite{QuantumCSPSearch}

\subsection{Translation of Algorithmic Descriptions of Discrete Functions to SAT with Applications to Cryptanalysis Problems}
Transalg is a software system meant to be used for SAT-based cryptanalysis. To implement Transalg methods to translate algorithmic descriptions of discrete functions to SAT are used.\cite{Transalg}

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics helps in searching for a needle in a haystack
}
In this paper Lov K. Grover presents his approach to Quantum Search, both on a conceptual and a practical level, detailing the algorithm and providing aid in visualising the operation via analogues to geometrical operations. The algorithm, as he puts it, require fundamentally simple circuitry compared to many other quantum algorithms, and provides a noteworthy improvement over classical search. His algorithm fundamentally creates an equal-probability outcome superposition of entangled qbits, and amplifies the probability of a desired outcome by process of repeated phase-shift of desired outcome probabilities and inversion about their average amplitude. Lastly, it is shown precisely how the amplitude amplification scales with input, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ for a search-space of size $N$, from which the computational complexity of the search algorithm, $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, follows.\cite{QMHSNH}

\subsection{Quantum Walk Speedup for Backtracking Algorithms}
Ashley Montanaro engages in reworking and refining quantum walk algorithms, based on nestled Grover Search across partially revealed search spaces in search trees. This is presented as a polynomial speedup in solving chiefly conjunctive normal form constraint satisfaction problems (CNF CSP:s) and general graph search problems, by integration into classical backtracking algorithms like DPLL. Particularly, the paper also specifies relaxed cases where an exponential speed-up is achievable over classical algorithms in the average case.\cite{QWSBA}


\chapter{Method}
Firstly, a delimitation to a reasonable number of target problems must be established, proposedly via discussion with the assigned supervisor. A selection must then be made as to which problems specifically to target. The initial approach will be to aim for a set of representative problems first and foremost. Inclusion of different variations and relaxations of the same problem, such as testing for finding both Hamilton paths and cycles, will be avoided. Only a particular class or type of problem tested should yield particular results, further problems within the class may be tested as well. For potentially proving any lower bounds, we will attempt whatever approaches appear applicable to the relevant reduction, to show a growth in problem input size by less than a factor of 2, at which point the Grover Search algorithm no longer improves the calculability of the problem. It is worth noting that any NP-hard problem approached will be solvable by the proposed method, since all problems in NP can be reduced to any NP-complete problem, thus also to SAT-problems to which Grover’s algorithm can be applied. Furthermore, no actual quantum computation or simulation need be performed for the sake of the thesis; the work to be done is bounded to classical problem reduction and analysis.
